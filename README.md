# TRADECALC

I am building this project to learn about unit testing and push notifications.

This project is a stock market calculator where the input is taken as the trading capital, risk to reward ratio and stop loss.

The output gets calculated as target which is calculated based on the stop loss and risk to reward ratio, returns that you will get in a trade and lastly the total capital after profit is also calculated

## Getting Started
Run the command `flutter pub get` to first get all the packages used in the project.

Run the command `flutter run` to run the app.
